# The Data
My Team, The Unquantifiables, were provided nationwide medicare utilizatian and provider payment data for 2013-2017 to complete a group project. The data consisted of 9M rows of data for each provider dataset.
# The Ask
We were tasked with analyzing, processing and communicating our findings from the data to our client, Healthcare Bluebook, in order to determine the following:

* 1. How payments and utilization changed over time with providers and hospital outpatient care?
* 2. Which procedures had the largest change in average payment and utlization? 
# The Process
Given the large amount of data, we utilized Pyton to read in, clean, create calculations and do an initial visualization for the project. 

My role consisted of cleaning the hospital utilization and payment data for 2013-2017 in Python, calculating the change in utilization and payments and creating visualizations for my data in Power BI.


# The Takeaways
*Challenges:*
Reading, cleaning and analyzing 27M rows of data proved to be the main challenge for this project, but I was able to lighten the load by reading in the data in chunks in Python.

*Rewards:*
My team and I were able to showcase our use of various data analysis and visualization mediums to a local Nashville business for review that could lead to possible future business decisions to be implemented.
